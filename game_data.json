    "llm": "5 minutes. Each machine makes one widget in 5 minutes, so 100 machines working in parallel will also take 5 minutes to make 100 widgets.",
    "slm": "To determine how long it takes 100 machines to make 100 widgets, let's break down the problem step by step. We are given that 5 machines take 5 minutes to produce 5 widgets. From this information, we can deduce the rate at which each machine works. Rate per machine = 1/5 widget per minute. This means each machine can produce 0.2 widgets per minute. Now, with 100 machines, we want to find out how long it takes to produce 100 widgets. Total rate = 0.2 widgets per minute × 100 = 20 widgets per minute. Time = 100 widgets / 20 widgets per minute = 5 minutes. It takes 5 minutes for 100 machines to make 100 widgets.",

    "prompt": "A farmer has 17 sheep. All but 9 die. How many are left?",
    "llm": "9 sheep are left. The phrase 'all but 9' means all except 9, so 9 survived.",
    "slm": "Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step: Total Sheep Initially: 17. Result of Death: All but 9 die. Interpreting 'All But 9 Die': This phrase can be interpreted in two ways, leading to different interpretations of what remains alive after some sheep die. Interpretation 1: 'All but 9 die' means that 9 sheep survive. If all but 9 die, it implies: Total Sheep = 17, Surviving Sheep (alive) = 9. Therefore, the number of sheep that died is: 17 (total) - 9 (alive) = 8 (died). Conclusion: After 8 sheep die, 9 are left alive. Interpretation 2: 'All but 9 die' could mean that all survive except for the 9 that died. This interpretation implies that no sheep were killed. Total Sheep = 17, Surviving Sheep (alive) = 17, Number of sheep that died = 0. Conclusion: All 17 sheep are still alive. Final Answer Based on Interpretation 2: Since 'all but 9 die' is more commonly interpreted as 'only 9 survive,' we will proceed with the first interpretation. Answer: 9.",
